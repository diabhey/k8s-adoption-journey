## Introduction

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Next, you will be buidling and pushing images for the `microservices-demo` app using docker to the DOCR repository you created in the [Setup DOCR](setup-docr.md) section.

1. Clone your `microservices-demo` repository if you haven't already (make sure to replace the `<>` placeholders first):

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_USERNAME>/microservices-demo.git
    ```

2. From the command line, change directory to the `microservices-demo` folder (if not there already):

    ```shell
    cd microservices-demo
    ```

3. Login to DOCR:

    ```shell
    doctl registry login
    ```

4. Run the `make-docker-images.sh` script after setting required environment variables first:

    ```shell
    export REPO_PREFIX="registry.digitalocean.com/microservices-demo"
    export TAG="v1.0.0"

    ./release-scripts/make-docker-images.sh
    ```

    !!!info
        This script will go through each of the microservices and perform a `docker build` and a `docker push` tagging each image with the service name and the `TAG` environment variable exported above.
        You will be pushing an initial release first to DOCR - `v1.0.0`, and use that to deploy to the `staging` and `production` environments in the upcoming sections. Later on, GitHub Actions will take care of building, tagging and pushing images to `DOCR`.

Next, you will learn how to setup DOKS and deploy the `microservices-demo` application to your development environment, as well as setting up `ingress` and `monitoring`.
